# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix 80+ TypeScript compilation errors that are preventing successful deployment through GitHub Actions. The errors include:

- Missing properties in mock objects (clearError in UseExercisesReturn)
- Incorrect enum usage (ErrorType references)
- Missing type definitions (jest-axe)
- Null/undefined handling issues in strict mode
- Type mismatches in test data
- Read-only property assignments (NODE_ENV)
- Missing required properties in User objects

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript compilation to pass without errors, so that the GitHub Actions deployment workflow can complete successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the type-check command runs THEN all TypeScript compilation errors SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN all type-related test failures SHALL be fixed
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN no TypeScript errors SHALL prevent compilation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for all test dependencies, so that test files compile without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jest-axe is used in tests THEN @types/jest-axe SHALL be installed and configured
2. WHEN UseExercisesReturn mocks are created THEN clearError property SHALL be included
3. WHEN User objects are mocked THEN all required Supabase User properties SHALL be present
4. WHEN AppError objects are created THEN the name property SHALL be included

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type handling across the codebase, so that strict TypeScript checks pass without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ErrorType is referenced THEN ErrorType.DATABASE format SHALL be used instead of string literals
2. WHEN NODE_ENV is modified in tests THEN proper environment variable mocking SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN nullable database fields are accessed THEN null checks SHALL be added
4. WHEN Exercise type is used THEN proper type casting or enum values SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test mocks to be properly typed, so that test compilation succeeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase client methods are mocked THEN all required properties SHALL be included
2. WHEN hook return values are mocked THEN they SHALL match the expected interface
3. WHEN environment variables are mocked THEN they SHALL have correct type assignments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fixes to be implemented in a separate branch, so that the main branch remains stable during the fix process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are implemented THEN they SHALL be done in a new feature branch
2. WHEN changes are complete THEN they SHALL be tested before merging to main
3. WHEN the branch is ready THEN it SHALL be submitted as a pull request for review
